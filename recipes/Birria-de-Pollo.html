<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This birria de pollo is deeply flavorful, rich, hearty, a little smoky and just plain delicious. Birria is a Mexican stew that originated in Jalisco. It is traditionally made with goat, lamb, or beef.</p>

In fact, chicken Parmesan is one of those meals that's often best made in your own kitchen. The main problem I have with most versions of Chicken Parmesan served in restaurants is that they drown the chicken in so much sauce and cheese that it ends up being a big soggy clump of chicken and cheese. But it doesn't have to be that way, not with this method.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>4 dried ancho chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
        <li>1 dried de Ã¡rbol chile, stemmed and seeded </li>
        <li>3 tablespoons canola oil, divided</li>
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Add chicken broth to a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium-high. Remove from heat and add dried chiles. Cover and let sit until chiles have softened, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large pot or Dutch oven over medium-high. Add 3 of the onion quarters, reserving the last quarter for later use, and garlic to pan. Cook, flipping once, until charred, about 6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat (do not wipe out the pot), and transfer onion and garlic to a blender. Add chicken broth, chiles, tomatoes, vinegar, 1 teaspoon salt, cumin, oregano, pepper, and cloves. Secure lid on blender, and remove center piece to allow steam to escape. Place a clean towel over opening. Process until combined, about 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour through a fine mesh strainer into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Season chicken with remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Add remaining 1 tablespoon oil in to the large pot; heat over medium-high. Add chicken; cook, flipping once, until golden brown, about 3 minutes per side.</li>
